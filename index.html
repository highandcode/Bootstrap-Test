                    <p>This book is not just about money. It's about how we are taught to think; how we are programmed
                        by schools, family, and friends to look at the rich as greedy no good bloodsuckers and
                        opportunities as risks. It is an attempt to reprogram minds to look at why we do what we do..
                        why do we buy all these shoes, clothes, cars, jewelry.. have we earned it or are we just trying
                        to maintain an image?</p>

                    <strong>By - Nola.</strong> While driving for the Thanksgiving vacation, my husband and I listened
                    to Robert Kiyosaki’s book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, on CD. This book helped us to expand and to think
                    outside the box when it came to money. It gave us many things to think about and other ways to view
                    our finances. I enjoyed it so much that I not only listened to it twice on CD, but also read the
                    book itself.

                    In his book, Kiyosaki reveals that he had two fatherly perspectives while growing up. His biological
                    father maintained an attitude towards money that kept him struggling financially throughout his
                    life. His friend’s father, who he spent a lot of time with, held a different perspective, and
                    ultimately prospered. The two men regarded money differently, which caused young Robert to compare
                    and ponder the different things each dad taught. In doing so, he had to choose which path to follow,
                    rather than just blindly accept what he learned. He applied these principles in his life, and, like
                    his rich dad, prospered financially.

                    I enjoyed the way Kiyosaki introduced us to both fathers. He puts us in the scene of action, rather
                    than lecturing us, and like he did as a boy, we learn from actions rather than words. This is more
                    successful, I think, than most financial books, which while helpful can be a little boring.

                    Kiyosaki presents the six lessons that his rich dad taught him, and then expands on them. He
                    provides examples and applications. Much of what he says caused me to change my normal perspective
                    as I considered a different way of thinking. Similarly, as I read, I could see phrases that I and
                    others have used that mark us as “poor.” In fact, over the Thanksgiving holiday, my dad unknowingly
                    repeated about six or seven things that Kiyosaki’s “poor dad” had said! These statements have caused
                    me to realign many of my thoughts on money.

                    As we drove, my husband and I frequently stopped the CD to discuss not only the changes in our
                    thinking but also the inspiration that occurred to us. We began seeking opportunities, rather than
                    just blindly accepting the fact that we were broke. We discussed business opportunities, and chances
                    we could “work to earn” rather than “work for money.”

                    If this book has a failing, it is that it is more of an overview than a how-to. It left me wanting
                    to learn more. However, I understand that Kiyosaki has several other books written that appear to
                    dive into the subject more thoroughly, and I look forward to reading those. Still, this works as a
                    great stepping-off point to make us reconsider our view of financial issues.

                    This was clear, well-written, and thought-provoking, and left me wanting to learn more. It made for
                    great discussion with my husband, and I felt like we both grew closer as we considered the
                    opportunities around us. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to increase their
                    financial knowledge.

                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" is a book by Robert Kiyosaki that tells the story of a boy with two fathers, one
                    rich and the other poor.12 The book focuses on how to use money as a tool for wealth development and
                    teaches the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.4 The book has
                    been translated into dozens of languages and has become the #1 personal finance book of all time.0
                    The author compares both fathers' principles, ideas, financial practices, and degree of dynamism,
                    and how his real father, the poor and struggling but highly educated man, paled against his rich dad
                    in terms of asset building and business acumen.3 The book explains several methods of managing
                    personal finance effectively and teaches the difference between working for money and having your
                    money work for you.</p>

            The book was originally self-published in 1997 before being picked up commercially to become a New York
            Times bestseller. It has since sold over 32 million copies and become a household name.[13] In his
            audio-book Choose to be Rich, Kiyosaki said that every publisher turned him down, and Barnes & Noble refused
            to stock the book initially. He places his focus upon talk shows and radio show appearances, of which The
            Oprah Winfrey Show had the biggest influence on book sales.[14] In April 2017 a 20th Anniversary edition was
            published and in a preface to this 20th Anniversary edition Kiyosaki asserts that an estimated 40 million
            copies of the book had been sold globally.[15]

        <h3>Praise and Support</h3>
        <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad has sold over 32 million copies[4]It was a very high selling book when it was released[5].
            It was published in 1997 and sold very quickly all around the world. Since this day it has been around for
            about 26 years now, and is still selling strong. It was popular on TikTok recently and people are now
            learning the marketing technique this book is teaching to become a millionaire. more than 51 languages
            across more than 109 countries, been on the New York Times bestsellers list for over six years,[6] launched
            a series of books and related products; and received positive reviews from some critics.[7] Actor Will Smith
            said he taught his son about financial independence by reading the book.[8] PBS Public Television station
            KOCE aired a 55-minute presentation of Kiyosaki titled "A Guide to Wealth" in 2006, which essentially
            summarises his Rich Dad Poor Dad book. PBS also honored him with an excellence in education award in
            2005.[9] Donald Trump did a literary collaboration with Kiyosaki in 2006 called Why We Want You to Be Rich,
            Two Men One Message, and a second book called Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich — And Why Most
            Don't in 2011.[10]
            American fashion entrepreneur and investor Daymond John has called the book one of his favorites.[11]</p>
        <h3>Criticism</h3>
        <p>A competing financial self-help writer, John T. Reed, says, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains much wrong advice,
            much bad advice, and virtually no good advice." He also states, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one of the dumbest
            financial advice books I have ever read. It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely
            accounts of events that supposedly occurred."[12]

            Slate reviewer Rob Walker called the book full of nonsense, and said that Kiyosaki's claims were often
            vague, the narrative "fablelike", and that much of the book was "self-help boilerplate", noting the
            predictable common features of such books were present in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He also criticizes Kiyosaki's
            conclusions about Americans, American culture, and Kiyosaki's methods.[1]</p>
